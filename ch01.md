###Introduction to Part 1##

介绍
  The goal of this book is to enable you to write Node.js programs of any level of complexity, from
simple utilities to complex applications that use several external modules and consist of several
layers of code, talking to external systems and serving thousands of users.

本书的目的是探索在nodejs各种复杂程度上的编程，从简单的工具到大型的（第三方组成的程序，面对成千上万的用户）

In order to do so, you need to learn about all the different aspects of Node.js - the tools, the
methodologies, the libraries, the APIs, the best practices - and you need to learn how to put all
of that together to create a working whole.

为了完成，你需要学习Node.js不同方面，
	1.工具
	2.方法
	3.函数库
	4.API
	5.最佳实践
同时需要灵活运用上述，一起工作。

Therefore, I have split this book into two parts: A collection of different basics in Part 1, and a
thorough tutorial on how to put these basics together to build a complex application in Part 2.
因此本书将分成两个部分：
   1. 基础介绍
   2. 一个演示程序，基于第一部分的基础知识，建立的一个复杂的应用程序，
In Part 1, every chapter stands on its own and isn’t directly related to the other chapters. 
Part 2 is more like a continuous story that starts from scratch and gives you a finished and working
application at the end.
Thus, let’s start with Part 1 and look at all the different facets of Node.js software development.
